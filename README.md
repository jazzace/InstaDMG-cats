InstaDMG-cats
=============

*This is entirely archival in nature, as everyone is now using [AutoDMG](https://github.com/magervalp/autodmg) instead of InstaDMG, until such time as AutoDMG is no longer relevant.*

Catalogue files used by the IAML when building master images using the InstaDMG workflow.

Note that I have not omitted my own locally-developed packages, as they might indicate what you might need to do to make it work for your own system. (It's also because it makes it easier for me to use this in production!) Feel free to fork the file and customize for your situation if that works for you. At the very least, you will need to comment them out.
